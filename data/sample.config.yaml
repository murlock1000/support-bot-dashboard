# Welcome to the sample config file
# Below you will find various config sections and options
# Default values are shown

# The string to prefix messages with to talk to the bot in group chats
command_prefix: "!c"

# Options for connecting to the bot's Matrix account
matrix:
  # The Matrix User ID of the bot account
  user_id: "@bot:example.com"
  # The URL of the homeserver to connect to
  homeserver_url: https://example.com

middleman:
  # Management room where proxied messages are sent and where actions are taken.
  # Can be an alias or room ID. Middleman must be able to join it on startup.
  management_room: "!1234567:example.com"
  # Anonymous senders
  # If set to true, relayed messages to management room will not contain
  # any sender information.
  anonymise_senders: false
  # Operate in "mentions only" for rooms that look like non-direct messages,
  # This is based on the nio "is_named" logic, ie a room is a named room if it has
  # 1) an alias or 2) a name. Direct messages often don't have names, they are
  # generated dynamically based on the participants.
  # When set to true, "mention_only_rooms" has no effect.
  mention_only_always_for_named: false
  # List of rooms to only relay messages from when explicitly mentioned
  # Any rooms here (alias or ID) will have messages relayed to the management
  # room only if the bot is mentioned in the message. This allows joining the bot
  # to rooms with a large amount of messages for support needs, for example.
  # When "mention_only_always_for_named" is set to true, this has no effect.
  mention_only_rooms: []
  # Reply confirmation with reaction (Optional)
  confirm_reaction:
    enabled: false
    # Success confirmation reaction symbol (Optional)
    success: "✔️"
    # Failure confirmation reaction symbol (Optional)
    fail: "❗"
  # Relay media replies from management room to original sender directly
  # When set to true, management room will send back media replies to original sender
  # When set to false, media replies will not be sent back to original sender because
  # we can't normally prefix `!reply` in the message body
  # (Optional, default: false)
  relay_management_media: false

storage:
  # The database connection string
  # For SQLite3, this would look like:
  #     database: "sqlite://bot.db"
  # For Postgres, this would look like:

  database: "sqlite://bot.db"

# Logging setup
logging:
  # Logging level
  # Allowed levels are 'INFO', 'WARNING', 'ERROR', 'DEBUG' where DEBUG is most verbose

  # thing - only use it to actually debug!
  level: INFO
  # Configure logging to a file
  file_logging:
    # Whether logging to a file is enabled
